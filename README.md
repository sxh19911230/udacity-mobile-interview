Started this project at 4:57, 12/20/2017. What I did before this is to read the description and looked into the json file.
I decided to make a HTML page with JS because I'm lazy and this is the easiest way to do it
So, I should finish or stop this project at around 8am. GLHF XD

Done at 6:15. It took about an hour and 15 min.
Did not expect to finish this that fast (mostly because I did not do the ui part so it's kind messy)
And i'm not sure if this is what you expected. Let me know if I did not do it right. :)
