# udacity-mobile-interview
Started this project at 4:57, 12/20/2017. What I did before this is to read the description and looked into the json file.
I decided to make a HTML page with JS because I'm lazy and this is the easiest way to do it
So, I should finish or stop this project at around 8am. GLHF XD

Done at 6:15. It took about an hour and 15 min.
Did not expect to finish this that fast (mostly because I did not do the ui part so it's kind messy)
And i'm not sure if this is what you expected. Let me know if I did not do it right. :)

The Problems I had:
1. The JSON file on the link has No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'.
   I tried to grab the file from your site at first but it's not allowed.
   So, to be nicer for the interviewers, I think make it accessable is better.
   
2. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.
   Then I tried to download it and load it directly without server. And, it gave me this error. This time flie in the browser begins with "file://" and this is the reason.
   Luckily, I had my apache installed in my PC and made it work.
   
3. No further problem. This assignment is quite straightfoward. And took me some time to remeber the regex, which is great.
